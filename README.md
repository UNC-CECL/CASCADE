# CASCADE

The CoAStal Community-lAnDscape Evolution (CASCADE) model is a coupled landscape and human-dynamics modeling framework. CASCADE couples elements of several large-scale models -- each critical in understanding barrier response to a subset of the aforementioned processes -- into a single geomorphic model of barrier evolution. Barrier3D, a quasi-3D spatially-explicit cellular exploratory model, is the core of CASCADE. It is used within the CASCADE framework to simulate the effects of individual storm events and RSLR on shoreface evolution; dune dynamics, including dune growth, erosion, and migration; and overwash deposition by individual storms (Reeves et al., 2021). The BarrierR Inlet and Environment model (BRIE, Nienhuis and Lorenzo-Trueba 2019) is used to connect individual Barrier3D models with alongshore sediment transport. Human dynamics are incorporated in CASCADE in two separate modules. The first module simulates strategies for preventing roadway pavement damage during overwashing events, including rebuilding roadways at sufficiently low elevations to allow for burial by overwash, constructing large dunes, and relocating the road into the barrier interior. The second module incorporates management strategies for maintaining a coastal community, including beach nourishment, dune construction, and overwash removal. CASCADE represents decisions about coastal land-use (e.g., housing markets) and community-level mitigation measures using an empirically-grounded agent-based real estate model ‚Äì the Coastal Home Ownership Model (CHOM). CHOM receives information about the coastal environment and acts on that information to cause change to the environment, including decisions about beach nourishment and dune construction and maintenance.


## Installation (work in progress, my rough notes for now)
This is the version of *cascade* used for the simulations in "The Future of Developed Barrier Systems: Pathways Toward Uninhabitability, Drowning, and Rebound" by Anarde et al., (in review). 

- requires Python 3.8 (you can download directly here)
- we suggest using a virtual environment for the following steps:
- requires Barrier3D, brie, CHOM: each must be installed using "pip install -e ." in command line in the top of each directory
- then "pip install -e ." in CASCADE directory
- if you're not using something like PyCharm, extend your system paths to brie, CHOM, Barrier3D
- run model from CASCADE directory

- within the README, make sure to explain that in CASCADE, the user is forced to specify a growth rate (input growth parameter files are not used)
- 
3. Install your local copy into a conda environment. Assuming you have conda
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ conda create -n cascade python
    $ conda activate cascade
    $ cd cascade/
    $ conda install --file=requirements.txt

    $ pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests::

    $ flake8 cascade
    $ pytest

   To get flake8, just conda install it into your environment.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
