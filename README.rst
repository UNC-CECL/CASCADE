CASCADE
=====

The CoAStal Community-lAnDscape Evolution (CASCADE) model couples several geomorphic models, incorporating SLR and overwash dynamics (Barrier3D, Reeves et al., in prep); dune dynamics (Coastal Dune Model; Dur√°n and Moore 2013); and large-scale coastline dynamics (BarrierR Inlet and Environment model; Nienhuis and Lorenzo-Trueba 2019) to simulate multi-decadal landscape evolution. CASCADE represents decisions about coastal land-use (e.g. housing markets) and community-level mitigation measures (e.g. beach nourishment, dune construction) using an empirically-grounded agent-based model in which homeowner and manager agents interact to represent collective decisions reflecting agent beliefs and inclinations.
